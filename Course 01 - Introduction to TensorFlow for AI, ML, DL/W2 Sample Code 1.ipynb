It might have taken a bit of time for you to wait for the training to do that, and you might have thought 'wouldn't it be nice if I could stop the training when I reach a desired value?' -- i.e. 60% accuracy might be enough for you, and if you reach that after 3 epochs, why sit around waiting for it to finish a lot more epochs....So how would you fix that? Like any other program...you have callbacks! Let's see them in action..."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":37,"metadata":{"id":"pkaEHHgqZbYv","outputId":"21ecc270-8260-48ca-dd07-ab561ac38381","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677699955967,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":117684,"user":{"displayName":"Shareyar Farooqui","userId":"05587113932021885845"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Epoch 1/15\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 18s 9ms/step - loss: 0.4736 - accuracy: 0.8300\n","Epoch 2/15\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 16s 9ms/step - loss: 0.3602 - accuracy: 0.8683\n","Epoch 3/15\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 16s 8ms/step - loss: 0.3215 - accuracy: 0.8813\n","Epoch 4/15\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 16s 8ms/step - loss: 0.2972 - accuracy: 0.8906\n","Epoch 5/15\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 18s 9ms/step - loss: 0.2793 - accuracy: 0.8969\n","Epoch 6/15\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 18s 9ms/step - loss: 0.2659 - accuracy: 0.8996\n","Epoch 7/15\n","1871/1875 [============================>.] - ETA: 0s - loss: 0.2524 - accuracy: 0.9064\n","Reached 60% accuracy so cancelling training!\n","1875/1875 [==============================] - 16s 9ms/step - loss: 0.2523 - accuracy: 0.9065\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<keras.callbacks.History at 0x7fdcf8aa77f0>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":37}],"source":["class myCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):\n","  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):\n","    if(logs.get('accuracy') >= 0.9): # Experiment with changing this value\n","      print(\"\\nReached 90% accuracy so cancelling training!\")\n","      self.model.stop_training = True\n","\n","callbacks = myCallback()\n","\n","fmnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist\n","(training_images, training_labels) ,  (test_images, test_labels) = fmnist.load_data()\n","\n","training_images=training_images/255.0\n","test_images=test_images/255.0\n","model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([\n","  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),\n","  tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation=tf.nn.relu),\n","  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax)\n","])\n","model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n","model.fit(training_images, training_labels, epochs=15, callbacks=[callbacks])\n"]}]}
